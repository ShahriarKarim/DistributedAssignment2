The video showcasing my assignment is on the report aswell.
The code uses proper naming and is documented with comments


first compile all of the files using javac
the Health App interface contains all of the unique functions

the rmiregisty is started automatically Once java Server.java is run, not manually, this is because I was having a little issue with java version environments, but this resolved it.

Lastly,
Create a new terminal then run java Client.java

Now you are able to access the 6 unique functions.
In the video, I forgot to mention that the Health information function also provides clients the ability to track their health and fitness progress.
